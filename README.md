# Salary Calculator for Team3

## Overview
The Salary Calculator for Team3 is a comprehensive salary calculation tool designed to handle complex payroll scenarios, including Excel integration, holiday pay calculations, and control room shift management.

This application was created because salary calculations were becoming too complicated to handle manually. It streamlines the process by importing shift data from **ShiftOrganizer Excel files** and automatically calculating pay based on work hours, holidays, and special conditions such as control room shifts. This eliminates the complexity and potential errors of manual calculations.
